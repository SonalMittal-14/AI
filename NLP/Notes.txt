Trainging ML model for NLP problems take lage amount of data and lot of computer resources. 
sometimes the small company can't able to afford it and sometimes they don't have large amount of data.
big companies like google , facebook etc they stated trainig the models on the bases of the datasets they have 

Freely Available Pretained Model are: 
Fasttext -> facebook
Tensorflow Hub -> Google
GPT3 -> Largest Neural network -> OpenAI -> Spend 4 million dolloar just to train the model

We can use these models with the technique called TRANSFER LEARNING use the model and fine tune it accordinly
